                <p id="p1">My name is Gayathri and I am an Electrical Engineer. After completing my degree course, I was just curious about the web development that was booming at that time and so I tried to learn it through some online resources.<br><br>
                After I started to learn them I tried to develop some website pages on my own and I also took some sample websites and tried to develop them. Later I wanted to become a full stact developer. I was able to learn concepts of front end and try to implement them. I also wanted to learn in depth about the front end and back end. This interest made me to join the University of Arizona Bootcamp.</p>
